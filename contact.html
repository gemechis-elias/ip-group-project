	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<p>For those travelers who are always making plans and reservations for a trip, it's no surprise that you might have every detail planned down to the second. From the minute you depart your home to the second you arrive at your destination, you might have every minute planned in between. Part of that planning is reserving a hotel room.
<br>
Often, travelers do not need to make reservations - usually, guests drive up, ask for a room, and get checked in that way. For the planner, however, reserving a hotel room is definitely an option and should be done to secure a room in case the hotel fills up.
